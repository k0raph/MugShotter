# MugShotter
Super small mobile android app I made to practice kotlin. 

This app allows you to secretly capture images with your selfie camera.

Context: A game people used to play in secondary school, was to call a 
friends name and as they turned around you would quickly snap their picture 
before they least expected it. The more unflattering the picture, the better 
the "mug shot".
